# reminders-of-inspiration

When you see a quote/photo or your friend says something wise, and you want to
remember to think about it again every so often, you add it to this little
extension!

Add your own custom content, and whenever you open a new tab, it will display
one of your reminders of inspiration.

Not on the chrome extension store right now, but you can install it by:

1. cloning this repository locally
2. going to chrome://extensions/
3. clicking "Load unpacked extension..."
4. selecting this folder
